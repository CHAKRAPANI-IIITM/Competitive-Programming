You are given an array.Your task is to print the length of longest consecutive subsequence. A longest consecutive subsequence is such that next element differ from previous by 1.

Input Description:
You are given with the length of array. Next line contains n space separated integers.

Output Description:
Print the length of longest consecutive subsequence.

Sample Input :
8
1 6 5 3 2 4 10 12
Sample Output :
6

Solution:
def lcs(ar):
    j = 0
    out = []
    for i in range(len(ar)-1):
        if ar[i+1]-ar[i]==1:
            j+=1
            if i==len(ar)-2:
                out.append(j+1)
        else:
            out.append(j+1)
            j = 0
    return max(out)
n = int(input())
lst = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))[:n] 
arr = sorted(lst)
a = lcs(arr)
print(a)
